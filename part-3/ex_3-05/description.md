As per exercise 3.1, the image sizes were:
- ```502MB``` for the **frontend**
- ```299MB``` for the **backend**
The modifications made in exercise 3.4 did not affect the image on a megabyte level.

The newly optimized image sizes are:
- ```338MB``` for the **frontend**
- ```135MB``` fpr the **backend**

Again, the frontend image did not compress to the given size, but my use of ```npm audit fix``` may have been the reason. Nonetheless, the reduction is significant compared to the original value.
