# NOTE: This file is based on the one created in exercise 2.6 - this nginx is not configured.

# I wasn't quite sure what the aim of this exercise was - after all, I did specify volume "database:/var/lib/postgresql/data" already in the previous exercise. However, I interpreted that the point was to bind a local directory (./database - OUTSIDE of the container) to be the container's database.

services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    restart: unless-stopped

  db:
    image: postgres

      - ./database:/var/lib/postgresql/data
